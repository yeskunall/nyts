Node.js wrapper for the YTS API.

> Currently only supports Node 6 and 7. Support for Node 8 will be added later on, but older versions will probably not be supported. Read more on this [here](https://github.com/yeskunall/nyts/issues/1). <br /><br />
>This documentation, and the module is a WIP. As of now, the package doesn't exist on NPM.
